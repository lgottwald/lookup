# lookup

Shared library for using lookup tables in the gams files generated by [sdoconv](https://github.com/rgottwald/sdoconv.git).
The file liblookup.so needs to be linked to the current directory from which gams will be executed. Then the library will be
found by gams and the lookups in the gams file will be approximated with cubic splines.

# Dependencies
This library depends on the following other libraries
- openssl
- [spline](https://github.com/rgottwald/spline.git)
- [cpplsq](https://github.com/rgottwald/cpplsq.git)
- [libsdo](https://github.com/rgottwald/libsdo.git)

OpenSSL should be installed on your computer and the other libraries will
be fetched automatically during build if they were not found.

# Build/Install

Standard cmake workflow. And make doc builds doxygen documentation.
